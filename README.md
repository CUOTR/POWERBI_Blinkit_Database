- Target urban growth in high-density cities (Mumbai, Delhi) ads and food/health influencer tie-ups; pilot provincial expansion in stable areas like Pune, Ahmedabad with localized via-card or UPI promotions.
- Send automated SMS/WhatsApp follow-ups 3-5 days post-delivery with quick 5-star review links and small incentives (e.g ₹50 voucher); reward neutral customers with extra referral points for inviting friends after rating.
